## **Conducto Demo**

Welcome to the Conducto demo. Conducto is great for all tasks that involve
pipelines, which pop up all over the place. In particular, Conducto is a
powerful tool for CI/CD and Data Science, and we have dedicated demos and
tutorials for each of those applications. Choose your own adventure!

Each demo will launch a local pipeline, executing on your machine, that will
be visible in our web app. If a browser tab does not open for you
automatically, follow the link printed in the console. You will see helpful
documentation in the right handle panel of your screen that will guide you
through the demo.
