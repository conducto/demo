### **Conducto Data Science Demo**

Welcome to our data science demo. To run the demo, you must first complete the
getting started instructions for Linux, macOS, Windows, or WSL which are
linked from our [Conducto for Data Science](
https://medium.com/conducto/conducto-for-data-science-59f426ee57b)
article.

Once you have completed that, run the full demo like this:

    python full_demo.py --local

Or run a demo for a specific topic with one of the other top-level
scripts.

Your demo will launch a local pipeline, executing on your machine, that
will be visible in our web app. If a browser tab did not open for you
automatically, follow the link printed in the console. You will see
helpful documentation in the right hand panel of your screen that will
guide you through the demo.
